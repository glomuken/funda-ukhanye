The design will be clean, inspiring, and user-friendly, reflecting the organization's mission of lighting young minds. 

Colour Scheme: A palette of warm, inviting colors combined with professional, calming tones.  

Typography: Clear and legible. Inter will be used for all text for its modern and accessible feel, with a hierarchical structure for headings (larger, bolder) and body text (standard size, good line-height). 

Layout and Design: Emphasis on clear calls-to-action and visually appealing imagery of children learning and engaging.
